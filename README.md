# Spotify-Amezon-clone-Front_End_Projects
This project is a front-end clone of two popular platforms: Amazon (an online shopping website) and Spotify (a music streaming service). 
The project demonstrates how to create responsive web pages using HTML and CSS to mimic the design and layout of these platforms.
